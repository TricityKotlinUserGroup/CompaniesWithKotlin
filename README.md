# Companies in Tricity with Kotlin

The goal of the below list is to gather a list of companies using Kotlin in their technology stack. The ticks in the columns "Android", "Backend" (...) specify the context where Kotlin is used.

_Remark: in order for the company to be listed here, the office located in Tricity has to own one or more teams owning projects using Kotlin. A counter-example would be a company with multiple offices in Poland, with an office in Warsaw coding in Kotlin, where its Gdańsk office would never touch Kotlin._
